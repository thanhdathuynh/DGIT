# DGIdb Gene-Drug Interaction Tool

A simple Flask web app that allows users to search for drug-gene interactions using the [DGIdb GraphQL API](https://dgidb.org/api/graphql).

## Our Focus

While the DGIdb contains interactions for a wide range of conditions, **this tool is specifically geared toward exploring interactions relevant to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**. The goal is to help users identify possible therapeutic targets or insights into gene-related drug interactions that may be relevant to the treatment and understanding of MDD.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dgidb-search.git
    cd dgidb-search

2. **Install requirements**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
